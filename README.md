# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Date Comparison Error
This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using date comparisons within MongoDB's aggregation pipeline. The error arises from incorrect date formatting or data type mismatches in the `$match` stage.

## Problem
The provided JavaScript code attempts to filter documents based on a date range. The aggregation pipeline uses the `$match` stage to filter by the `createdAt` field. However, due to an invalid date format or data type issue within the `$match` stage, the query fails.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that the dates used in the comparison are valid and formatted correctly. The solution code demonstrates the proper usage of `Date` objects for date comparisons.  It provides a corrected `$match` stage that performs the comparison accurately.
